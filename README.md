# TODO

This is a very simple todo list app built with Electron.

## Installation

You can download this app from [Realease page](https://github.com/JayXie9499/todo/releases) or download the source code and build your own one.
The app directory is located at `%APPDATA%/Local/todo` when installing with `Setup.exe`.

## Note

This app uses a modified version of [electron-prompt](https://github.com/p-sam/electron-prompt).
